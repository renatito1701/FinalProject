# Project Proposal

## Project Description

__Data-Set__: we will be working with the **World Happiness Report** dataset for the year 2017. This data was gather and the dataset created by the **Sustainable Development Solutions Network** and we stumbled upon it on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). The happiness scores and ranking use data from the *Gallup World Poll* where the question asked respondents to think of a ladder with the best possible life for them being a **10** and the worst possible life being a **0** and to rate their own current lives on that scale. The inspiration for the dataset came from wanting to know which countries rank highest in overall happiness and how each countries compares favorably to a Dystopia.

__Target Audience__: Our Target Audience is people from the age of 19-34 who are either looking to study abroad, move to a different country when they finish their studies or that wish to do some travelling before settling down somewhere. My project will answer the following questions for my audience:

* What the average happiness score is by continent and or region?
* What the main factors contributing to the happiness score for the top 15 countries?
* What are the happiest countries per continent and what variable contributes most to their score?

## Technical Description
__Q:__ How will you be reading in your data (i.e., are you using an API, or is it a static .csv/.json file)?

__A__: We are going to be using a static .csv file which we are going to read in through R.

__Q__: What types of data-wrangling (reshaping, reformatting, etc.) will you need to do to your data?

__A__: We arenâ€™t going to have to do too mush data-wrangling because the .csv has already been shaped to find the information we need to answer our questions.

__Q__: What (major/new) libraries will be using in this project (no need to list common libraries that are used in many projects such as dplyr)

__A__: We are going to be using ggplot, data.table, leaflet, maps, .

__Q__: What major challenges do you anticipate?

__A__:  Major challenges we anticipate are going to be displaying our data in a way that accurately depicts our message. Another challenge might be creating charts that using different data like GDP, freedom and generousity while still show world happiness levels.
